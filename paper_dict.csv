10.1093/jmammal/gyad107,"Large mammals in temperate climates typically display seasonal patterns of habitat use. However, these patterns are often overlooked because large mammals are usually surveyed at annual intervals. In addition, most studies focus on a single species and ignore other species with which the focal species could interact. Knowing seasonal patterns of habitat use in multiple species and understanding factors that cause these patterns can provide further detail on population dynamics and guide effective conservation planning. Here, using dynamic occupancy modeling, we analyze 11 years of camera-trap data collected in northwestern Anatolia, Turkey, to investigate seasonal habitat use of 8 large-mammal species: Brown Bear (Ursus arctos), Eurasian Lynx (Lynx lynx), Gray Wolf (Canis lupus), Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes), Wild Boar (Sus scrofa), Roe Deer (Capreolus capreolus), European Hare (Lepus europaeus), and Red Deer (Cervus elaphus). For each species, we study the strength of seasonality in habitat use and its dependence on human population density and elevation, which have been shown to affect distributions of species in the region. Although all species exhibited seasonality in habitat use, the strength of this seasonality varied among species; it was strongest in Wild Boar, Roe Deer, and Brown Bear. Moreover, except for Brown Bear, all species tended to avoid sites close to humans. The species responded differently to changing elevation; increasing elevation had both positive and negative effects on species-specific colonization and desertion probabilities, and these effects were likely related to either feeding habits or tendency to avoid humans. These results indicate that seasonality should be taken into consideration in population studies. However, because species differ, seasonality patterns should be identified separately for each species of interest, as differences in these patterns can explain the underlying dynamics of habitat-use patterns more accurately."
10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.142637,"The contamination status on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the Croatian terrestrial ecosystem was investigated by analyzing two classes of contaminants in adipose tissue of male European brown bear (Ursus arctos, N = 27) collected in 2021 and 2022. In addition to seven indicator polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), for the first time seven polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were analyzed in terrestrial species from this region. Sum of mass fractions detected in adipose tissue ranged from 0.011 to 0.463 ng g-1 lipid weight (lw) for the PBDEs, and from 0.652 to 30.17 ng g-1 lw for PCBs, with two orders of magnitude difference in the median value for these two groups of POPs (PBDEs: 0.022 ng g-1 lw; PCBs: 2.307 ng g-1 lw). PCBs dominated over PBDEs with a share of over 94 % of the total mass fractions of both groups of analyzed POPs. Results of the comparison of the PCB levels in the adipose tissue of brown bears reported here and in previous investigation from this region showed decrease in PCB-28, but increase of PCB-118 and PCB-180, while other congeners seemed to have reached a steady-state level in the environment over a ten-year period. Among the compounds analyzed in this study, BDE-47, PCB-153 and PCB-180 were the dominant congeners. Somewhat higher sum of PCBs was measured in April compared to October, although not statistically significant, indicating possible impact of winter hibernation causing concentration of lipophilic compounds due to body fat loss. Revealed POP levels in brown bears are consistent with the data on the low contamination of the Croatian terrestrial ecosystem in general."
10.1186/s12917-024-03964-6,"BACKGROUND: In Bosnia and Herzegovina, domestic and wild carnivores represent a significant driver for the transmission and ecology of zoonotic pathogens, especially those of parasitic aetiology. Nevertheless, there is no systematic research of Trichinella species in animals that have been conducted in Bosnia and Herzegovina, even though trichinellosis is considered the most important parasitic zoonosis. The available results of the few studies carried out in Bosnia and Herzegovina are mainly related to the confirmation of parasitic larvae in the musculature of domestic pigs and wild boars or data related to trichinellosis in humans. The objective of our study was to present the findings of a comprehensive investigation into the species composition of Trichinella among 11 carnivorous species within the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as follows: red fox (Vulpes vulpes), grey wolf (Canis lupus), brown bear (Ursus arctos), wildcat (Felis silvestris), pine marten (Martes martes), European badger (Meles meles), weasel (Mustela nivalis), European polecat (Mustela putorius), Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), but also dog (Canis lupus familiaris) and cat (Felis catus).
RESULTS: In the period 2013-2023, carnivore musculature samples (n = 629), each consisting of 10 g of muscle tissue, were taken post-mortem and individually examined using the artificial digestion method. In the positive samples (n = 128), molecular genotyping and identification of parasitic larvae of Trichinella spp. were performed using a PCR-based technique up to the species/genotype level. Positive samples were used for basic PCR detection of the genus Trichinella (rrnS rt-PCR technique) and genotyping (rrnl-EVS rt-PCR technique). The Trichinella infection was documented for the first time in Bosnia and Herzegovina among red foxes, grey wolves, brown bears, dogs, badgers and Eurasian lynx, with a frequency rate of 20.3%. Additionally, the presence of T. britovi infection was newly confirmed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, marking the initial documented cases. Furthermore, both T. britovi and T. pseudospiralis infections were observed in the wildcat population, whereas T. britovi and T. spiralis infections were detected in pine martens. Consistent with previous research, our findings align particularly regarding carnivores, with data from other countries such as Germany, Finland, Romania, Poland and Spain, where T. britovi exhibits a wider distribution (62.5-100%) compared to T. spiralis (0.0-37.5%). T. britovi is more common among sylvatic carnivores (89.0%), while T. spiralis prevails in wild boars (62.0%), domestic swine (82.0%) and rodents (75.0%).
CONCLUSION: The results of our study represent the first molecular identification of species of the genus Trichinella in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Additionally, our findings underscore the necessity for targeted epidemiological studies to thoroughly assess trichinellosis prevalence across diverse animal populations. Considering the relatively high frequency of trichinellosis infection in investigated animal species and its public health implications, there is an evident need for establishing an effective trichinellosis surveillance system in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
10.1098/rspb.2023.0921,"Large carnivores (order Carnivora) are among the world's most threatened mammals due to a confluence of ecological and social forces that have unfolded over centuries. Combining specimens from natural history collections with documents from archival records, we reconstructed the factors surrounding the extinction of the California grizzly bear (Ursus arctos californicus), a once-abundant brown bear subspecies last seen in 1924. Historical documents portrayed California grizzlies as massive hypercarnivores that endangered public safety. Yet, morphological measurements on skulls and teeth generate smaller body size estimates in alignment with extant North American grizzly populations (approx. 200 kg). Stable isotope analysis (δ13C, δ15N) of pelts and bones (n = 57) revealed that grizzlies derived less than 10% of their nutrition from terrestrial animal sources and were therefore largely herbivorous for millennia prior to the first European arrival in this region in 1542. Later colonial land uses, beginning in 1769 with the Mission era, led grizzlies to moderately increase animal protein consumption (up to 26% of diet), but grizzlies still consumed far less livestock than otherwise claimed by contemporary accounts. We show how human activities can provoke short-term behavioural shifts, such as heightened levels of carnivory, that in turn can lead to exaggerated predation narratives and incentivize persecution, triggering rapid loss of an otherwise widespread and ecologically flexible animal."
10.1111/1755-0998.13915,"Continued advancements in environmental DNA (eDNA) research have made it possible to access intraspecific variation from eDNA samples, opening new opportunities to expand non-invasive genetic studies of wildlife populations. However, the use of eDNA samples for individual genotyping, as typically performed in non-invasive genetics, still remains elusive. We present successful individual genotyping of eDNA obtained from snow tracks of three large carnivores: brown bear (Ursus arctos), European lynx (Lynx lynx) and wolf (Canis lupus). DNA was extracted using a protocol for isolating water eDNA and genotyped using amplicon sequencing of short tandem repeats (STR), and for brown bear a sex marker, on a high-throughput sequencing platform. Individual genotypes were obtained for all species, but genotyping performance differed among samples and species. The proportion of samples genotyped to individuals was higher for brown bear (5/7) and wolf (7/10) than for lynx (4/9), and locus genotyping success was greater for brown bear (0.88). The sex marker was typed in six out of seven brown bear samples. Results for three species show that reliable individual genotyping, including sex identification, is now possible from eDNA in snow tracks, underlining its vast potential to complement the non-invasive genetic methods used for wildlife. To fully leverage the application of snow track eDNA, improved understanding of the ideal species- and site-specific sampling conditions, as well as laboratory methods promoting genotyping success, is needed. This will also inform efforts to retrieve and type nuclear DNA from other eDNA samples, thereby advancing eDNA-based individual and population-level studies."
10.1134/S0012496623700692,"A morphological description is provided for a unique find of a frozen mummified subfossil brown bear (Ursus arctos L., 1758), found for the first time ever. The find is a well-preserved bear carcass of approximately 3500 years in age. Results of computed tomography and DNA testing are discussed."
10.1002/ece3.10156,"The dietary nutrient profile has metabolic significance and possibly contributes to species' foraging behavior. The brown bear (Ursus arctos) was used as a model species for which dietary ingredient and nutrient concentrations as well as nutrient ratios were determined annually, seasonally and per reproductive class. Brown bears had a vertebrate- and ant-dominated diet in spring and early summer and a berry-dominated diet in fall, which translated into protein-rich and carbohydrate-rich diets, respectively. Fiber concentrations appeared constant over time and averaged at 25% of dry matter intake. Dietary ingredient proportions differed between reproductive classes; however, these differences did not translate into a difference in dietary nutrient concentrations, suggesting that bears manage to maintain similar nutrient profiles with selection of different ingredients. In terms of nutrient ratios, the dietary protein to non-protein ratio, considered optimal at around 0.2 (on metabolizable energy basis), averaged around 0.2 in this study in fall and around 0.8 in spring and summer. We introduced the minimal non-fat to fat ratio necessary for efficient maintenance metabolism. This ratio varied across seasons but never fell beneath the theoretically estimated minimum to ensure metabolic efficiency. This population thus managed to ingest diets that never exerted a lack of glucogenic substrate, suggesting that metabolic efficiency may either be a driver of active diet selection or that natural resources available to bears did not constitute a constraint in this respect. Given the considerable proportion of fiber in the diet of brown bears, the relevance of this nutrient and its role in foraging behavior might be underestimated."
10.1111/cobi.14133,"Reduction in population size, with its predicted effects on population fitness, is the most alarming anthropogenic impact on endangered species. By introducing compatible individuals, genetic rescue (GR) is a promising but debated approach for reducing the genetic load unmasked by inbreeding and for restoring the fitness of declining populations. Although GR can improve genetic diversity and fitness, it can also produce loss of ancestry, hampering local adaptation, or replace with introduced variants the unique genetic pools evolved in endemic groups. We used forward genetic simulations based on empirical genomic data to assess fitness benefits and loss of ancestry risks of GR in the Apennine brown bear (Ursus arctos marsicanus). There are approximately 50 individuals of this isolated subspecies, and they have lower genetic diversity and higher inbreeding than other European brown bears, and GR has been suggested to reduce extinction risks. We compared 10 GR scenarios in which the number and genetic characteristics of migrants varied with a non-GR scenario of simple demographic increase due to nongenetic factors. The introduction of 5 individuals of higher fitness or lower levels of deleterious mutations than the target Apennine brown bear from a larger European brown bear population produced a rapid 10-20% increase in fitness in the subspecies and up to 22.4% loss of ancestry over 30 generations. Without a contemporary demographic increase, fitness started to decline again after a few generations. Doubling the population size without GR gradually increased fitness to a comparable level, but without losing ancestry, thus resulting in the best strategy for the Apennine brown bear conservation. Our results highlight the importance for management of endangered species of realistic forward simulations grounded in empirical whole-genome data."
10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.138354,"Environmental contaminants like arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) or lead (Pb) may disrupt hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axes due to their endocrine toxicity potential. Resulting long-term physiological stress or adverse effects on wildlife reproduction and ontogeny may cause detrimental effects at the individual and population levels. However, data on environmental metal(loid)s' impact on reproductive and stress hormones in wildlife, especially large terrestrial carnivores, are scarce. Hair cortisol, progesterone and testosterone concentrations were quantified and modelled with hair As, Cd, total Hg, Pb, biological, environmental and sampling factors to test for potential effects in free-ranging brown bears (Ursus arctos) from Croatia (N = 46) and Poland (N = 27). Testosterone in males (N = 48) and females (N = 25) showed positive associations with Hg and an interaction between Cd and Pb, but a negative association with interaction between age and Pb. Higher testosterone was found in hair during its growth phase compared to quiescent phase. Body condition index was negatively associated with hair cortisol and positively associated with hair progesterone. Year and conditions of sampling were important for cortisol variation, while maturity stage for progesterone variation (lower concentrations in cubs and yearlings compared to subadult and adult bears). These findings suggest that environmental levels of Cd, Hg and Pb might influence the HPG axis in brown bears. Hair was shown to be a reliable non-invasive sample for investigating hormonal fluctuations in wildlife while addressing individual and sampling specificities."
10.3390/ani13020220,"The evanescent and invisible communication carried by chemical signals, pheromones, or signature mixtures or, as we prefer, the pheromonal individual fingerprint, between members of the same species is poorly studied in mammals, mainly because of the lack of identification of the molecules. The difference between pheromones and the pheromonal individual fingerprint is that the former generate stereotyped innate responses while the latter requires learning, i.e., different receivers can learn different signature mixtures from the same individual. Furthermore, pheromones are usually produced by a particular gland, while the pheromonal individual fingerprint is the entire bouquet produced by the entire secreting gland of the body. In the present study, we aim to investigate the pheromonal individual fingerprint of brown bears in northern Italy. We collected the entire putative pheromone bouquet from all production sites in free-ranging bears and analyzed the entire crude extract to profile the individual fingerprint according to species-, sex- and subjective-specific characteristics. We were able to putatively characterize the brown bears' pheromonal individual fingerprints and compare them with the partial pheromone identifications published by other studies. This work is a step forward in the study of the complexity of chemical communication, particularly in a solitary endangered species."
