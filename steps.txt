1. preprocess the text
	- remove punctuation etc
	- turn words like 'swimming' to 'swim'

2. convert such a preprocessed text to a binary vector
	- the vector will have the length as all the words in all the abstracts
	- each paper will have its own vector of this length
	- 1 if the word is in the abstract and 0 if it is not

3. feed this vector into a model that has a binary outcome
